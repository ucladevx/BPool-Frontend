# BPool Frontend

## Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

## Run app in developement mode

```sh
yarn start
```

## Adding css

We are using scss for this project, so when you need to add a new scss file, you must import it in index.scss, which is compiled into an all-encompassing file index.css.

## Testing

Run tests with the command
'''sh
yarn test
'''

Each component can and should have a test file. Currently, check the login folder for a very basic template of what to do to add something.
